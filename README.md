# stylisbot
my twitch bot. not great LOL!

## about
I made this bot for when I occasionally stream, and for fun. I practically have zero js or html or css experience so LuL .

Hosted on my local machine with nodejs.

Source code is available for all here! Please contribute, I have no idea what I'm doing!

## setup

Requires nodejs, and the `tmi.js` and `say` modules.

To use with any account, change the `username` json object to that of the account you want to log in with.

**For the sake of security, you must include the oauth in the command line arguments to log in.

When they're installed, `node . {account oauth}` in the root directory.
