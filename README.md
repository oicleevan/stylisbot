my twitch bot. not great LOL!

## about
I made this bot for when I occasionally stream, and for fun. I practically have zero js or html or css experience so LuL .

Hosted on my local machine with nodejs.

Source code is available for all here! Please contribute, I have no idea what I'm doing!

## setup

Requires nodejs.

Requires the `tmi.js` and `say` modules.

When they're installed, `node .` in the directory.
